# CS5600 Computer Systems - Spring 2023

This repository contains materials for the **CS5600 Computer Systems** course at Northeastern University for the Spring 2023 term. 
The course is instructed by **Prof. Schedlbauer**.

## Course Description

The course studies the structure, components, design, implementation, and internal operation of computer systems, focusing mainly 
on the operating system level. It covers computer hardware and architecture, current operating system components and construction 
techniques, and introduces distributed operating systems. The course also discusses concurrency and distribution issues, with examples 
from real operating systems. Students are exposed to system concepts through programming exercises.

## Prerequisites

While there are no specific course prerequisites, students are expected to have reasonably strong programming experience and a working 
knowledge of C. Some understanding of key concepts in computer science at the undergraduate level is presumed.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Trace the operation of context switching and program loading
- Read part of an OS kernel and demonstrate an applied understanding of how abstract concepts apply to implementations and user programs
- Use synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores, condition variables) to synchronize threads as demonstrated in a programming assignment
- Describe the operation of page tables and OS page faulting mechanisms for implementing demand allocation, demand loading, and copy-on-write
- Understand performance characteristics of hard drives; optionally demonstrate knowledge of RAID configurations via a programming assignment
- Understand permissions and access control lists as implemented in Linux and Windows; optionally describe common software exploits

## Learning Assessment

The learning outcomes will be assessed and graded through:

- Homework Assignments (40%)
- Practicums (40%)
- Practicum Presentations (5%)
- Final Exam (15%)

Please refer to the course syllabus for more information on assignment policies and grading.

The professor has reported that for last term's grades, 86% (45 out of 52) of the students received an A.

And 79% (60 out of 76) of the students received an A in this term. (A A- B+ B- F) -> (60 8 4 2 2).

## Personal Thoughts and Feedback

Please note that the following feedback represents my personal perspective and experiences in the CS5600 Computer Systems course, and there 
might be some biases in my observations. I learned a lot. But I do have some issues.

Throughout the CS5600 Computer Systems course, I have experienced a variety of teaching styles and approaches that have both aided and hindered 
my learning process. While I appreciate the professor's emphasis on critical thinking, I find that his indirect responses to clear and simple 
questions can sometimes be confusing or frustrating. In these instances, seeking assistance from the teaching assistants has proven to be helpful 
and more straightforward.

Another issue I have encountered is the frequent changes to homework requirements. Although the professor refers to these changes as clarifications, 
I believe that altering assignment details, especially close to the due date, is unfair to students who have already invested time and effort into 
completing the tasks based on the original guidelines. One example of this was when the professor changed the question from 6 to 8 on the due date of 
an assignment. It was unclear what the professor was doing during the first 6 days, and he did not make an announcement about the change until a student 
pointed it out. When he finally made the announcement, he said it was obvious.
The lack of clear communication about these changes can lead to confusion and frustration among students.

Lastly, the design of some homework assignments could be improved. I would not say 100% "poor". That's not right. But in my experience, certain assignments have been unclear, and their usefulness in 
terms of learning and understanding the course material has been questionable. For example, the first homework assignment was meant to help students 
learn C, but its content and due date did not align with the needs of the class. The assignment was too easy and not useful, as it was due two weeks 
after the second and third homework assignments. Another example is the homeworks before Practicum I. The design is not fixed and clarified. And most 
students need to change the design for Practicum I.

While expressing these concerns directly to the professor may not be productive or well-received, I encourage my fellow students to provide 
constructive feedback through course evaluations or other appropriate channels. Sharing our experiences and suggestions can help improve the 
course for future students and promote a more effective learning environment.

Also, there are some pros.
- Using teams
- Interesting Practicums
- Professor is trying to have some humor
- Grading is very high, most students will receive an A
- Workload is Okay

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Schedlbauer for his dedication to teaching and for providing invaluable insights and guidance throughout 
the CS5600 Computer Systems course. I also want to extend my appreciation to the **teaching assistants** and tutors for their support and assistance during 
office and tutoring hours.

Lastly, I would like to thank my fellow students for their collaboration, sharing ideas, and engaging in insightful discussions throughout the course. 
It has been a pleasure learning alongside all of you.
